#Student Info
Qili Sui
Programming language: Standard ML
*****Important Note****** 

(1)Because of the llvm version gcc on mac, I chose to use Linux machine to run my compiler. 
So, the invokeAssemblerLinker() of my compiler doesn't work for llvm gcc on mac.
Please test and grade my code on a machine that have "real" gcc installed. Thanks much. - Qili

(2) Test files are in input/smlfunc. input directory is at the top level of the repository.
    aseembly file and excutables are generated in input/smlfunc.

#What is working:
1.Implemented succesfully - print the numbers between 1 and 100(test02.sml, test02.s, test02)
2.Implemented succesfully - calculate and print the factorial of numbers between 1 and 100(test01.sml, test01.s, test01)
3.Implemented successfuly - Implement literal strings that can be printed directly but not used within expressions.(test04.sml, test04.s, test04)
4.Implemented succesfully - Implement function/method/procedure calls for your programming language(See test01.sml - Recursively Call Function Factorial())



#What is not working:
1.Implemented partially - (test03.sml, test03.s, test03)print the numbers (in order) between 1 and 100 that are divisible by neither 3 nor 5
